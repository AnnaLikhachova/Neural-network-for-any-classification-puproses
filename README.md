## General info
This project is Neural network for any classification purposes
Artificial Neural Networks are effective for high dimensionality problems. NN are theoretically complex but, fortunately, there are deep learning frameworks, like DL4J, that can help you set deep neural networks with only a few lines of code.
NN is a machine learning algorithm that can help solve classification problems. Its unique strength is in its ability to emulate human thinking. There are many classification problems for which neural networks show the best results.
